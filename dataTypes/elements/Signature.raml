description: |
  A Signature holds an electronic representation of a signature and its supporting context in a FHIR accessible form.
  The signature may either be a cryptographic type (XML DigSig or a JWT), which is able to provide non-repudiation proof, or it may be a graphical image that represents a signature or a signature process.
